# sf-coding-standards
Very similar to the GNU Coding Standards written by Richard Stallman and other GNU Project volunteers.

# Can be used for:
 * Apex (Salesforce) ✅
 * C++ ✅
 * Java ✅

# Indent code using Allman style ✅
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style

 * Code is indented using Allman Style — opening curly brace brackets are on new
 * lines to vertically align with closing curly brace brackets — and not in K&R
 * style which is taught in most schools, textbooks, and websites — where the
 * opening brace is on the previous line, and never aligns with the closing brace.
 * 
 * All code is contained within an 80 character right margin, preventing an ugly
 * horizontal scroll bar.
 * Indentations are tabs, not spaces, to reduce the number of characters used as
 * Apex has a limit of 6 MB per org.
 *
 * Single SOQL statments are broken into multiple lines, in a staircase indentation.
